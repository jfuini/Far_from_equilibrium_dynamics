# Far_from_equilibrium_dynamics
The source code, data, visualizations and analytics behind my paper "Far-from-equilibrium dynamics of a strongly coupled non-Abelian plasma with non-zero charge density or external magnetic field", which can be found here: https://inspirehep.net/record/1355413

Most raw data is provide in data, although possibily not all that is needed to make all figures in the mathematica notebooks.  If that
is the case let me know.
